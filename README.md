# NetSwitchPro
NetSwitchPro scans and displays all Windows network adapters (physical, virtual, Bluetooth) with type filters, lets you select two to toggle their states with one button, remembers your theme, language (7 options), and last pair, and includes a console that logs actions and errors for stable, transparent operation on any PC.
